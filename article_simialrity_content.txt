introduction
  intractive educational sytems
  large n of items causes dificult management
  automatic ddetction of similarities
  reasons why it is useful, managemet of problem pool
  recommender systems
  approaches - model based, similarity based
  similarity data (problems, solutiaons, performance)
  what is article about
basic setting
  different posisiblilities of computing similatity
  siilarity matrix (mathematical model)
  - correctnesss of answers, metrics (pearson, yule, sokal,..)
  - performance
    - time
  - statement
second level of similarity
evaulation
  data
  simualted data
  datasets
    umimecesky
    matmat
comparasion of similarity measures
  simuated, correctness of clustering
  real, compare measures
  how amount of data affects measures stability
    second level of simialrity
  response time utilization
  pearson -> euclid
discussion
  we focused on automatic computation of similarity
  how to choose simialrity measure
  what amount of data is enought

  know how to choose from pool
  navigate pool - good to know smilarity of items
  "empowering humans"
  creation of study materials and exams
  focus on progamming - grid based robotsystems
  item
    item statement
