This work focuses on measuring of item similarity in tutoring systems using correctness of answers from users. We knew that some unexplained regularities may appear in similarity of items. In observer tutoring system they caused separation of items into surprising clusters. This work focus on exploitative analysis of possible causes. We found multiple high-level factors affecting similarity of items and therefore its clusters and projections. We show that structure of system can affect item similarities. E. g., preferred answer of users causing separation by correct answer or user interface affecting structure of missing data. We validated this using simulations. Finding are useful for further usage in analyzed system or replicating similar experiments in other tutoring systems.
